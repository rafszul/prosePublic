# #bleach_v16_62 

is an interactive story taking place in near and dark future on european continent. it was hacked together by [we are the playMakers](http://wearetheplaymakers.com/) as a complimentary feat to [#transeuropacaravans](http://citizenspact.eu/) an awesome initiative by [european alternatives](http://www.euroalter.com/) 

as a preview: [http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/](http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/) materials from work on characters and character-sheet creation pasted together with suitable narrative

#* * * update * * * 

the pilot, which so far is the real thing has to be [downloaded as a .zip](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62/archive/master.zip), unpacked and run in the browser (we talking: bleach_v16_62-005-3.html)

i left it off as is and have no inclination to get back to untill needed so no optimising, smoothing up etc 

btw firefox does not support advanced css filters so it might not display the real thing but i am not sure how big the difference does it make
