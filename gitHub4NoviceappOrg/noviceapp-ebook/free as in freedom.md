# free as in freedom

#### or on licensing, code ownership and open knowledge principles

first of all let me just say that my grandma would classify all of these and related concepts and their practical implications as cases of "nie ruszaj gowna bo smierdzi".

which is what was generally accepted as a norm and perfectly reasonable stance to take when presented with problematic issues concerning ideas of ownership, intellectual property, patents, innovation, incentives, research and ways of financing such research.

some would take it even further and talk about structural inequalities in our societies, quote one or another confused thinker from 19 century and thus demolish any possibility for the case to look even remotely plausible.

this obviously was allowing officials for carpet dismissal of all arguments that followed especially when it came down to real life implementations, shaping future policies or making an actual decision.

#### okay so we are cool about "nie ruszaj gowna bo smierdzi" but how do we deal with the space it's taking up in the living room … oh, did i say too much already ... shit ...

"nie ruszaj gowna bo smierdzi" means there is no elephant. period. and there is definatly no talking about any "taking the elephant outside" okay.

#### sure, fine ... but hang on a minute ... wasn't the living room supposed to be "the communal area"?

that seems like a serious issue and cries for some form of organised "redistribution of resources" ie space ... let's just make the whole proces amicable and not too upsetting for anyone and we might just go by. let's talk welfare, public education, health system and advancment of sciences powered by reaserch paid for by owners. let's fix some debt relief programmes for poor ... i meant third world countries.
let's talk improved standards of living and we will all be a okay.

#### hang on now that you mentioned it who exactly is going to clean the shit from the living room?

well that's debatable so some form of elections should be enough to find out who will make a decision on those issues. but in any case there dopesn't seem to be any alternative anyway. we might present arguments and speculate about potential better worlds we could create, the history shows clearly whenever such speculation was put in practice it failed spectacularly. just think about french revolution or soviet collectivisation practices in early 20 century which seem like grotesque and gory representation of the power that stems from principle every software developer learns to be mindful ofo: "hardware is a bitch"

#### yeah sure ... i get the point we are not talking about the elephant and the outside but the guys in the garden seem to be having some party and they don't seem too crazy abot the inside so what was the deal again? why would i want to stick around?


ell the advent of digital made this approach unatainable and created conditions whereby we could run some tests and check out approaches which earlier would be dissmissed as utopian sophistry and in my humble opinnion rightly so.


in fact it turned out that there is a bunch of people who within last 40 or so years and for completely different reasons went on to tinker with the system and being not bound by physical realities managed to create the exact utopian worlds some crazy people were talking and writing about for millenia.

… shit



haven  ( their




it turned out that the stench was not because of the merit of a theoretical case    "ne ruszaj gowna bo smirdzi" and if you ask them they will say there wasn't actually any problam and why there would be any.




already started doing so and actually already established methodologies alowing for different approaches  have some  in their professional capacities wanted to  to  geeks

so if you go to our website and scroll down to the very bottom you'll see that:
