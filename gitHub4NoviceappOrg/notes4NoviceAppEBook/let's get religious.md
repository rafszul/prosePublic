by which i mean we need to be clear on the main principles but i do not intend to preach. luckily there are only few of these principles, they easy to understand and most of the time they are self-explanatory.

so treat this chapter as a list even though i would try to provide some explanations, clarifications, etc. in some cases i might go to certain extent elaborating on one or another aspect which for some reason i find particularly interesting from theoretical perspective or needed to explain it's implications in practice in some specific circumstances which i hope could throw some light on the core rules.

okay, let's get ridiculous
