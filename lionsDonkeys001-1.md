it doesn't seem to be getting any better though and in fact i've seen situations where decision making bodies were paying for advice only to turn around and in almost choir like agreement go for a solutions which … well, which doesn't really seem to be related to project to begin with.   

what i find most astonishing is the conviction that often accompanies such decisions! it would make even most brilliant techies loose the confidence in their understanding of how things work and myself i certainly often felt that way :-)

and even though i always have the option to pack my toys and do something else it isn't always easy to turn your back on all those committed people often with pretty decent ideas who regardless of their hard work but not having the correct expertise are often completely oblivious to the fact they are on a collision course with one or another fairly well known aspect of web dev reality which will make the whole thing go down. or should i say fail to take off.

i think the issue you brought up is really one of the most important ones and had always been holding back innovation and progress. it is also one of the most difficult to tackle, unless … unless we get the bulldozers in and do some levelling up work which does sound a bit radical but then again i would say an army of donkeys led by a lion stand a pretty good chance against an army of lions led by a donkey
