## intro to doc's section for diasporachangemakers.net

### so just to clarify, what is diasporaChangemakers.net?

at most general level i guess it is social networking software package intended to become a virtual representation of a social network of 100 individual changemakers who secured a place on diaspora changemakers leadership programme provided by the RSA. that's the basic idea

### but there is more to diasporaChangemakers.net

so appart from being a social networking portal with smokes and mirrors like:

- built in content management system with
- customisable editorial workflow;
- making it a fully blown reliable web publishing suite;
- with multitude of features supporting online training for small to midium organisations and teams
- team creation or project menagement suite
- that will improve commumication among the employes.
- it could also work as data visualisation tool
- or all time favourite data dashboards
- or forums for suport of initiatives aimed at easy and intuitve exchange of resources/skills available within a comunity with emphasis on
- smaller networks and groups with local being the word key

an example could be a community surrounding a local market or a street using their page on the network as means to organise and manage recurent, monthly event in the park at the top of the road. this page for this community is automatically fully integrated with google api and callendars on the phones of its users, with their email aplications, file storage services like google drive ot dropbox and alowing for exchange of documents, invoicing, assets management etc.

so all in all the platform could also serve as a responsive and very powerfull tool for academic research focused on social community mapping and analysis utylising methodologies and ability to visualise tabular data like in this graph:

secured within wordpress shell and armed with technologies like d3.js or JSON API, the network, it's conceptual structure, design and methodology hacked together by London based duo weAreThePlayMakers

we hope that at the very least we should give you an oportunity to get as much exposure to the modern web, it's aproaches, methods and ethos that your fragile human brain can take and absorbe without too much of a risk of breakdown






this was our intention from the start; to build a low traffic community and help those within establish themselves on digital platforms.

our hopes are that by exposing you guys to modern web technologies we will help you make more informed decisions once you will face inevitable question what technologies to use to promote your initiatives online.

you don't need to know any code, no php in here is necessary nor even HTML. what we do need from you is to actively think about the platform and reserve two minutes everyday to engage on the network while asking yourself: "what would I change that would make my interaction with the site more productive, engaging, interesting or even fun?"

once you have found something and this could be anything all you need to do is follow the link in the sidebar that reads "____" and leave a note, voice recording or make a screencast.

we probably won't get back to you immediately but we will definitely pay attention to your request.

in addition we are setting up a group of volunteers who would like to work closely with us on the features already in place or partially in place. this group has a working name of "one mean usability testing team" and they will be asked to log in to the network in the morning before they had a chance to have their coffee. that way we hope to test our platform and ensure highest quality of its features.
