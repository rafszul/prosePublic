## intro to doc's section for diasporachangemakers.net

### so just to clarify, what is diasporaChangemakers.net?

at the most general level it is a social networking software package intended to become a virtual representation of a social network of 100 individual changemakers who secured a place on diaspora changemakers leadership programme provided by the RSA.

that's the basic idea but there is more; diasporaChangemakers.net is not only a social networking site buit on wordpress but also a tool created for the need of an academic research run by the RSA and focused on community creation among changemakers.

the network basis and foundation were designed and built on wordpress by London based duo of digital producers weAreThePlayMakers who also hope to introduce users of the platform to some aspects of modern web technologies and aproaches.

essentially diasporachangemakers.net is you

it is your network, your community, it could become your product and much more.

you are the designers, the developers, the menagers... and you are also responsible for making coffee ...

how could that be you might be asking? well the moment you engage with the community via the network; the moment you pose a question on the forum; or send us a message asking for a feature you are joining the developers team and are officially granted permission to grow a beard, drink two buckets of coffee a day and start suffering due to internet explorers incompatibility with pretty much everything.

okay the last bit was a bit of an exaggeration but my main point is as valid as it was. you are a part of our team; this platform is your platform; it will grow only because you grow and it will become what you will make of it.

this was our intention from the start; to build a low traffic community and help those within establish themselves on digital platforms.

our hopes are that by exposing you guys to modern web technologies we will help you make more informed decisions once you will face inevitable question what technologies to use to promote your initiatives online.

you don't need to know any code, no php in here is necessary nor even HTML. what we do need from you is to actively think about the platform and reserve two minutes everyday to engage on the network while asking yourself: "what would I change that would make my interaction with the site more productive, engaging, interesting or even fun?"

once you have found something and this could be anything all you need to do is follow the link in the sidebar that reads "____" and leave a note, voice recording or make a screencast.

we probably won't get back to you immediately but we will definitely pay attention to your request.

in addition we are setting up a group of volunteers who would like to work closely with us on the features already in place or partially in place. this group has a working name of "one mean usability testing team" and they will be asked to log in to the network in the morning before they had a chance to have their coffee. that way we hope to test our platform and ensure highest quality of its features.
