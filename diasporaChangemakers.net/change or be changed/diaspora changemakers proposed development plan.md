## diaspora changemakers proposed development plan
aim: creation of vibrant community of change-makers as per

the idea was to create social networking site for participants of the courses

we propose to change the focus on projects undertaken by the participants of the courses rather than individuals themselves

this shift would allow for the site to work as a primer to project management and in fact could be developed as such tool

initially however it could work as a repository of documents and digital PR suite

after signing in users would primarily be able to set up their project boards and search through projects set up by other members

apart from the usual following the updates, commenting and so on there could be an option to get involved with the projects in specified by the project owner manner

this would allow individuals to not only share experiences but actively support each other and even work together

the network would be build on Wordpress using multisite functionality which would guarantee security of the data as well as ease of maintenance

the client (RSA) apart from having root access to the files on the server will also be given access as "super admin" which grants permissions to administrate the whole network and make network wide changes

the users on the other hand will be given an "admin" access to the projects they manage/own

this would make the organisation of the activities much easier to overlook and would ensure clear information structure as well as security of the sites

the site will come with a section of instructional short videos on how to use the site and manage projects

as well as interactive web application for developing and maintenance of projects web presence on digital platforms





primary functionalities would include:

blog -> all Wordpress

project management suite

Data driven network graph as central part of user interface

Digital PR suite (network graph) complete with interactive and informative components guiding through the process of setting up presence of individual projects on social media platforms

Full integration with g+, Facebook, Twitter, etc

"Skills" centered buletin board for project managers as well as those interested in getting involved





Things to consider:

Variations of "views" of the network graph (projects, individuals, countries, etc) on different levels of "depth" (network-general-high, project-midscale, document-low, etc)
