# mapyf.io

##

since among social enterpreneurs that we came accross in recent months community run web app like the one from the example above seemes to be some kind of hit bordering on unhealthy fixation in cases of innovators being on far end of digital - analog continuum; we decided to  set off to work on [a template for a comunity site like the one depicted above].

we decided it's time to put to rest all those unfortunate community managers running around like headles chickens trying to realise their visions of online domination by means of unspecified community management and "resourcess mapping" toolkit beefed up with data driven dashboards and reporting abilities so to enable for more accurate analysis of the community's resources. the initial assumption and reason d'etre being improved efficiency in management of these resources.

thank you very much, to whom shall i address the invoice?

in my view these poor wretches shall be given some space to breathe as they only now started to get used to the digital edge, importance of ones ability to quicly adapt or refocuse with the only limit being the limits of ones imagination. and most importantly, time.

the working name for this template is mapyf.io and we are comited to soon have it at least on github.



// try to forget all the stuff evolution beat into our neural makeup by killing our colective ancestors in a variety of ways. the truth is we are no different than fred flinstone in the world from the jetsons but somewhat less funny. gateways, distribution networks with their botelnecks are all gone online and positions surrounding distribution of resources are hardly the hottest shit around.

just ask owner of hub westminster network who looked at similar to mapyf.io project and expressed his annoyance and irritation due to the volume of mundane but necesseary admin work to run and maintain hub network's 60 sites around the world. aparently it is a lot of admin work... a lot a lot of admin work. he didn't mentioned anything but i won't be surprised if there is a custom bulit system and the only person who knows what is going on is some fat guy stuck in the internet.
