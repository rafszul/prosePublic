In web development forget the "platform" there are already too many.

Don't try to be Google. You're not!

Don't try to be Facebook, linked in. Amazon or WordPress.

You're not.

Unless you are in which case can I have your autograph?

If you have to do web dev to any extent use existing platforms and integrate for ducks sake.

Create blueprints for networks of "brick and mortar" services or businesses that fit within some community, cause or b2b/b2c network within a geographical area.

Locality will keep the network low and provide reasonable number of businesses or potential business enterprises.

Regardless of the nature/context there will always be a needs for a scheme for rapid development of assets and digital products of various caliber.

You will need to be able to make a case with references to some "bigger picture" in front of some local overlords.




They will give you the mandate and might end up being your first clients so make yourself useful.

They will give you your letter du marque and might be used as free "credit of trust card" while dealing with some local actors within a community.

This could provide advantage and enable otherwise inaccessible markets.

There are always around some monopolies hidden away in the shadows of offline admin platforms

Most of all Letter du Marquee gives you permission to disrupt and wage war on your patrins enemies.

Chose your battles wisely though and always try to target mechanisms rather than humans.

In fact never ever directly target individual humans.

If you know or have a suspicion that you are already doing it, stop whatever it is you are doing.

Give over your decision making responsibilities to someone else.

When scrutinizing mechanisms or structures be specific and show initiative.

In fact there is no trying with that one.

Be swift, effective and ruthless but minimise the collateral damage.

Chose ezzio over little boy.

Purges are bad publicity




But if you are within an organisation remember this will work only in high conflict situation and when things are going your way.

It might be and often is that there is no official declaration of war and there are no clearly defined options.

This will often be the case when whole apparatus is apathetic, confused and lacks vision the direction.
