## prep

this is a random collection of blog posts, emails and other documents that formed initial conceptual basis for development of diasporachangemakers.net.

the material in this appendix covers only the initial months and is solely focused on development and design of diasporachangemakers.net which was intended to repleace existing diasporachangemakers.co.uk provided by Voist Ltd. who for this purpose clonned developed for them by manifesto wordpress theme used on  mapifychurchstreet.co.uk. so it could be used by the rsa and changemakers.

eventually guys from Voist found the project too overwhelming and went on to work on their main stuff which was and is mapifychurchstreet.co.uk.

the last part (2.15) contains the final project proposal presented to Gaia and Mathew by rafszul in late 2013 which formed the bluprint for the current site.
