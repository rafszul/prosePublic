## diasporachangemakers.net user participation

what is important for me to mention and for you to remember is that diasporaChangemakers.net is not your ordinary social networking site or online forum with extensive functionalities. nor it is a collection or group of blogs with similar theme. nor is it a project management suite or similar product developed by some unknown web devs stuck in front of their multiple monitors and disassociated from their product.

diasporaChangemakers.net is your product and the moment you engage with the community, with us, the moment you pose a question on the forum or ask for a feature to be included on the site you are joining the developers team and are officially granted permission to grow a beard, drink two buckets of coffee a day and start suffering due to internet explorers incompatibility with pretty much everything.

okay the last bit was a bit of an exaggeration but my main point is as valid as it was. you are a part of our team; this platform is your platform; it will grow only because you grow and it will become what you will make it.

you don't need to know any code, no php in here is necessary nor even HTML. what we do need from you is to actively think about the platform and have everyday two minutes reserved for asking yourself: "what would I change that would make my interaction with the site more productive, engaging, interesting or even fun?"

once you have found something and this could be anything all you need to do is follow the link in the sidebar that reads "____" and leave a note, voice recording or make a screencast.

we probably won't get back to you immediately but we will definitely pay attention to your request.

in addition we are setting up a group of volunteers who would like to work closely with us on the features already in place or partially in place. this group has a working name of "one mean usability testing team" and they will be asked to log in to the network in the morning before they had a chance to have their coffee. that way we hope to test our platform and ensure highest quality of its features.
