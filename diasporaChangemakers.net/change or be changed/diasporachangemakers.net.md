## is you

it is your network,

your community

and your creation.

you are the designers,

the developers,

the menagers...

you are also responsible for making coffee...

the moment you engage with the community via the network; or pose a question on the forum; or send us a message asking for a feature you are becoming a part of an ongoing development process and are officially granted permission to grow a beard and wear fake glasses; you get voucher for two buckets of coffee a day and you are granted permission to begin lamenting about internet explorers incompatibilities with pretty much everything

in few words we are a part of one development team and this platform is as much your platform as it is mine;

it will grow with you and it will become what you will make of it

nothing more nothing less
