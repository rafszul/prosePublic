## rsa - diaspora changemakers



Diaspora ChangeMakers is a new project that seeks to identify and bring together the UK’s most promising individuals of African origin with a desire to support African communities in the UK and Africa.

Led by the RSA with Comic Relief and Unbound Philanthropy, this project will involve a number of activities, among them a UK-wide recruitment campaign to identify our ‘Diaspora ChangeMakers’, leadership development courses to build their capacity for making change, and the creation of a new ChangeMakers Network that will enable them to meet online and offline to share ideas and advice. The programme will run until early 2015.

### Who are we looking for?

Diaspora ChangeMakers can be defined as individuals with some kind of personal, historical, cultural or family link to Africa, who are working to improve the lives of people in their community of heritage.

To be considered for the project, individuals must have:


   * Some experience of using social action to support other people
   * A cause/passion they want to address in their community of heritage (whether that community is based in the UK or in Africa)
   * A current project or a desire to develop one that addresses that cause/passion
   * A clear case that they will benefit from the programme activities



'Social action' is anything that directly improves the lives of other people, such as running a social enterprise that offers health services, or a charity which trains young people for employment.

‘Projects’ are organised activities such as ventures, campaigns, businesses, charities, community initiatives, movements and social enterprises. They range from the very small to the very large.

### What are the other minimum requirements?

Eligible participants must:


   * Consider themselves to be part of a diaspora community from Africa
   * Be free to attend a series of training sessions and events (No more than 10 in total between February 2014 and March 2015. This may require some travelling, with costs subsidised)


### Frequently Asked Questions

What will the Diaspora ChangeMakers get out of the project?

This project is for anyone who feels they can benefit from building their skills and connections, and are passionate about improving the lives of their African or African diaspora community. The course will enable Diaspora ChangeMakers to:


   * Develop their skills – Diaspora ChangeMakers will enhance their competencies in communication, creativity, leadership and ideas generation, among other areas



   * Build their connections – Diaspora ChangeMakers will forge new connections with other Diaspora ChangeMakers, as well as with entrepreneurs and social innovators in other networks


   * Grow their venture – Diaspora ChangeMakers will have the opportunity to start a new venture or take an existing one to the next level

### What does this look like in practice?


Diaspora ChangeMakers will have access to the following activities:

   * Leadership training (including a residential course)



   * Diaspora ChangeMaker workshops to develop skills and project ideas


   * Newsletters, a special website and social media activity showcasing the participants’ activities


   * Access to RSA Fellowship Network events, for example our Social Entrepreneur Network


   * The RSA’s Skills Bank (a time bank linking our expert Fellows with those in need of help)


   * These activities will take place throughout the UK (barring Northern Ireland)

### When will I find out whether I have been successful?
This is the first stage of the application process. A second stage will require candidates to undertake a more detailed application. You will be notified in early December as to whether you have made it through to the second stage. A final decision will be made in early 2014.
### When will the project start and finish?
The activities will begin in early 2014 and finish in March 2015, though we anticipate the Diaspora ChangeMakers Network will continue beyond this.
Where can I find out more?
