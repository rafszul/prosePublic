Diasporachangemakers.net is a platform designed and developed for a particular group of people.

These people are part of African diaspora in the UK who applied for a place on diaspora changemakers programme run by RSA commencing in 2014.

However together with the team at rsa, weAreThePlaymakers would like to see this online  community grow outside of the initial scope.

We would very much like to see that.

At the moment we suggest subscribing to our email list which will give you an access to all the articles and discussions that will be taking place on our network.

We will be working towards expanding this access in the future and will duly inform those on the list once changes are made.

Thank you,

Raf
