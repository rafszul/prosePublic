## diasporaChange preliminary issues


what are the project requirements from Voist perspective

the specification is vague on number of issues which are of crucial importance if the technical implementation is to serve the purpose of the project

the development of a networking platform needs to be guided by the needs of those who will use the network

technical implementation (even though in general terms standard for social networking sites) needs to serve the purpose specific to the users of this particular network

this is to be achieved on every level from micro-interactions up to feature implementation

which is to give away the scope of Voist involvement

if it is creation of the network by means of technical expertise

then back to the drawing board and start ground up ux research (which is what the (A) seems to be)

if it is only implementation of technical functionalities as specified by the brief

then they are done, bye bye

different focus -> (A) might not be reciprocated -> might lead to conflicting interests -> need to ensure (A) does not hinder (B)
