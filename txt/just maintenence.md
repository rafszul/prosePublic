# Just some maintenance

## the site will be down for most of ...

Hi everyone, just to let you know we will be switching off certain features of the site and make some changes in the way it operates which will take place mostly during ... <date>.

We thought it would make sense to shut down the whole site so not to confuse anyone. if for any reason ...

## you have an urgent need to write a blog?

we can surely appreciate that and get you fixed with an editor access which will give you access to the admin and you can get on with your stuff. just know that things might get funny; disapear and the n appear again and other such stuff. just be aware it is not your imagination it's just an operation theatre and we are operating a live patient; we hope the patient will survive but get out of the hospital significantly changed. so ...

## what will change?

- ### main changes to the user interface (UI).
Well the main [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) as you see it now will remain largely as it is. Some things will move around in terms of sidebar links but you should be able to find them all on your profile page.  From which we plan to remove bookmarks, notes and two other features which i don't even remember and which are currently there.

- ### changes to the information architecture or map of the basic network.
Most of you probably won't feel too many of these changes. Most of these are strictly technical and will only expand the accessible to you knowledge base. If you experience any issues with your links and feeds just let us know and we will work things out together.

## as for the side most immediately accessible to you...

We mean the stuff that we feel should be accessible to you the moment you log in? we've been actually asking ourselves the same question.

## what do you think should change?

I know it's rude to reply with a question but really what do you think the site should do for you?

- ### Could you try to use simple keywords instead of description:
(five rows of three one line text boxes)

- ### If you feel like writing more or don't like method of writing tags above feel free to go ahead here:
(want to write more than 160 words how about [shooting us an email](info@wearetheplaymakers.com))

- ### Which features currently present you guys think are most important to you:
(Poll?)

- ### Which of the features you liked about the previous site and are now missing or you find hard to navigate to?
(text box 160 words)

We can really do a lot of stuff that probably your own site couldn't easily do for you :-) seriously, we really know this stuff and we understand the problems you might be facing with administering your site or network or even stuff like digital PR. just think about this and ask us a question or two.

## That's the reason we are running this site.

The reason d'entre for this network we always hoped was that some of the services it will get you exposed to will give you some idea about how far web technology could improve the way you are working on your ideas and the way you are doing regardless of what you are doing!!! Seriously guys it would be awesome if we could do that!? anyway...

## some changes might seem kind of radical

... but not really affecting you and we really look forward to see how they will work for you if at all. one of these is introduction of [markdown]() in the main editor as the only option available on the client side.  

[You can read about some of the reasons behind here.]

We though this would greatly improve visibility of changemakers on line and we think it is for benefit of everyone at the minimal cost and any negative impact on your time guys while publishing through the site.

## finally, editorial schedules are looming over the horizon

which means we are going to be taking a leap at organising our editorial work and beating ourselves into shape in a more structured and supported by technology manner. if in any way you are planning to publish on the network material that excedes usual and light weight social public updates then do get in touch with us.

we would fix you with an author access ([user access explained]()) maybe we could work out for you a weekly spot, help you with writing a structured copy and provide you with initial feedback. Seriously this helps a lot and we will give you some info which we kind of gathered up from the net which seemed to work well with others.

besides, if you haven't tried this before believe me there is nothing better than writing a text with others. no matter whether it is wikipedia article written by many editors or github repository as long as it allows for an open and free discussion.

it could be fun so get in touch

## so, just to sum up:

we hope you took the possibility to let us know how we are doing our stuff and filled in the boxes above. if so thanks a lot we really appreciate your feedback and will try to address all of your ideas and points raised.

thanks again, sorry for inconvenience and length (believe me i really feel the pain; it's 2 o'clock in the morning and i have three more of these to write) and i hope to hear from you soon and at some point meet you guys all.
