#[user access explained]:

## we have five user types on the network:

- ### subscriber:
that's your basic access. you tend to get to see everything without restrictions [public access]
- ### author:
- ### editor:
- ### administrator:
- ### super admin:  
you really don't want to have access to this stuff. if for any reason you think you actually really do want to have this access we are interested to hear what you would want to do with it once you do.  
 after which we will be happy to give it to you provided you go through clearance at [rsa.diasporachangemakers.net  ]
at some point we would like to introduce some form of access via api but at the moment you'll be on your own. it's not such a big deal but you need to know some stuff before you start being creative ;-)

once you have such access.
