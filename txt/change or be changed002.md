change or be changed

last year shortly after establishing ourselves as ["we are the playmakers"](http://wearetheplaymakers.com/) we started to work on a website for a London based rock band. they had sweet post grunge sound and we liked the material enough to be interested in working with them.  

there was this one thing though about the band; they had no front-man and no lyrics. none at all and they were called "void star" … seriously

then as I was working on svg based layout for a web app for them we got some news they found [paulo](https://www.facebook.com/thepaperboats). or actually paulo found them. 

paulo was a man on a mission. being in portugal at the time he discovered void star on soundcloud; wrote lyrics; recorded the vocals and sent the whole thing back to the guys in london.

a few weeks down the line and void star was no more. paulo gave them direction and purpose and with a strong and clear voice reminded all of us that our freedom is absolute and we are responsible for the world we will all be living in:

"change or be changed"

our understanding is that you are one of those individuals who decided to take this responsibility seriously and embark on a journey that could  bring about positive change where it is needed

that's great and we are happy to say we are just the same; our area of operation is quite different though. our aim is to bring web tech closer to those who engage in making the positive change. our understanding is that we are all different and we have all different skills and experiences. we know our stuff you know yours and the most awesome stuff gets born when we combine our skills together.

not everyone needs to know what node.js is and why it is so awesome or why it takes a day to transfer a domain name from one host to another. we believe the world would be a sad and poorer place if that was to happen. but being all for node.js we believe … we know, that a certain level of familiarity with modern approaches and methodologies used on the web could make all the difference for any initiative regardless of it’s scope or focus.

don't worry though we will try not to geek out on you too often and at the very least we would ask you for an open minded approach to note taking and an ability to take the initiative which i believe you all have otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this.

in short think of the team powering [diasporachangemakers.net](http://diasporachangemakers.net/) as your very own bunch of friendly but relentless digital pirates and internet based guerrilla fighters.

as long as we are around and you are happy to engage with us online we will make sure your project has a place where it can grow and build up its online presence and most definitely we will ensure you are not one of the unfortunate founders and directors who end up wasting time and resources looking for some php wizards or genius programmers to do the job for them.

both php wizards and genius programmers are the mythical creatures of the past and we salute them with respect and keep on rewriting the web to make it even more awesome.

we have a number of ideas we would like to present to you and we will be posting stuff here and chasing you around with emails and  on twitter but in the meantime keep up with changing the world and allow me to introduce you to, // let me introduce you to ...

ladies and gentleman, I give you the army of one:
