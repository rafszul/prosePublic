last year shortly after establishing ourselves as "we are the playmakers" we started to work on a website for a London based rock band. they had sweet post grunge sound and we liked the material enough to be interested in working with them.  

there was this one thing though they had no front-man and no lyrics. none at all and they were called "void star" … seriously

then as I was working on svg based layout for a web app for them we got some news they found paulo. or actually paulo found them. 

paulo was a man on a mission. being in portugal at the time he discovered void star on soundcloud; wrote lyrics; recorded the vocals and send the whole thing back to guys in london.

few weeks down the line and void star was no more. paulo gave them direction and purpose and with strong and clear voice reminded all of us that our freedom is absolute and we are responsible for the world we will all be living in

change or be changed

our understanding is that you are one of those individuals who decided to take this responsibility seriously and embarked on a journey that could  bring about positive change where it is needed

that's great and we are happy to say we are just the same our area of operation is quite different though. our aim is to bring web tech closer to those who engaged in making the positive change do not necessarily need to know what node.js is and why it is so awesome or why it takes a day to transfer a domain name from one host to another.

not everyone needs to know this stuff and the world would be a sad place if that was to happen. but being all for node.js we believe … we know that certain level of familiarity with modern approaches and methodologies used on the web could make all the difference for any initiative regardless of its scope or focus.

don't worry though we will try not to geek out on you too often and at most we would ask for open minded approach to note taking and ability to take initiative which i believe you all have otherwise you won't be reading this.

in short think of the team powering diasporachangemakers.net as your very own bunch of friendly but relentless digital pirates and internet based guerrilla fighters.

as long as we are around and you are happy to engage online we will make sure your project has a place where it can grow online and most definitely we will ensure you are not one of those unfortunate founders and directors who end up wasting time and resources looking for some php wizards to do the job for them.

php wizards are the creatures of the past and we salute them with respect and keep on rewriting the web to make it even more awesome.

we have a number of ideas we would like to present to you and we will be posting stuff here and chase you around with emails and dm on twitter but in the meantime keep up with changing the world and allow me to introduce you, let me introduce you ...

ladies and gentleman, i give you the army of one:
