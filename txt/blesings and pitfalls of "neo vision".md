i don't know guys how you see the project and what are your hopes in terms of where it is heading but myself i see it as potential means to fill in the gap which only few years ago i was unaware even existed and now i find myself continuously reevaluating my estimates how big it actually is. 

believe it or not but those who spend most of their time talking to machines do see things differently and understand the reality in a manner that is profoundly different than those who are on analog side of reality.

what's more complexities of programming languages allow to completely deprecate usual modes of thinking, perceiving the reality and solving it's most common everyday puzzles.

think of the way coders see/understand (or in fact merely attempt to see/understand) their surrounding reality as type of neo vision. what's neo vision you might ask. well, remember matrix? remember the way neo was able to see when within the matrix? this is it! but don't get me wrong i am not trying to boast and express the supremacy of one mode over the other. 

neo vision gives a much more complex depiction of the reality and it is very easy to fall into humongous pitfalls together with legions of other coders inclined to see things the same way. this can lead to serious detours and as one particular way does not have to be the actual representation of the surrounding circumstances it gives a result similar to the one pursued by catholic dogma in the medieval ages. the world is flat and that's it. why? because thats what it says in the book. how about other books? la la la la la la la there aren't any la la la la and so on

just look at the way old school programers are unable to get their heads around all this "user is your god" bullshit! feature is feature and as long as it's working devs are perfectly good to perform some form of patting on the back and move on to the pub downstairs to debate the robustness of server architecture and triple star implementation of the requirements as specified by the client in the brief. 

so what only five people a day are actually willing to use the system and go for default font and drop down menus which remember first implementation of windows on the pc. the point is the system can take five million of these pesky users even though they don't really seem to be wanting to come and enjoy delights of our work.

add to this equation some happy old school business man thinking brought from the school of economics from the seventies and you end up with dev ops of the nineties. a creature so twisted, so  and so immune to learning and improvement only   profoundly twisted creature
