An Open Competition will be organised by the CATALYST consortium to contribute increasing project impact among community platforms.

The Open Call will award 2 to 3 participatory platforms with necessary resources to trial the tools, processes and methodologies developed through the project research activities, among their own communities. The competition will be launched around September 2014, so that the tests can occur from January to April 2015.

We will soon provide you with more details regarding this call. In the meantime, stay tuned or contact us for more information!
