OVERVIEW

The CATALYST project is funded by European Commission’s DG CONNECT through the FP7 research-funding programme.

The project brings together deeply experienced community-partners engaged daily in curating very large online communities on social innovation and citizen engagement platforms, and leading academic research partners specialized in Collective Intelligence (CI).

CATALYST will undertake technological developments aimed at radically improving collaborative knowledge creation through ground-breaking functionalities intended to mobilize CI for the public good, and will test these next generation solutions in authentic, real world settings.

Within a CI Spectrum ranging from Sensing to Collective Action, CATALYST focuses on Contested CI (Sensemaking and Ideation), which recognises the centrality of deliberation, argumentation and public debate. In order to understand and support the dynamics of multilingual social and deliberation networks, the project will look at:

Human-assisted online tools to inexpensively harvest the vast amount of data and knowledge that develop in social media, and facilitate collective ideation, creativity and citizen engagement;
Analytics to measure the quality of the collective intelligence dynamics back to the community to make the collaborative process significantly more effective.
Academics and community-partners will be in close dialogue with software developers. Community-partners’ “pain points” have already been identified. A mapping between pain points and research concepts will be established, moving to use cases, which will drive rapid prototyping and testing via an Agile methodology.

The CATALYST project will deliver an ecosystem of CI services that will augment partners’ platforms with Web-based Annotation tools; Recommenders to help users prioritise attention; Online creativity triggers; Interactive Visualizations, and Social Network and Deliberation Analytics. A coherent user experience will be delivered through a CI Analytics Dashboard.

All project developments will be carried out under an open source / free software license.

OPEN CALL

To increase project impact among community platforms, the CATALYST consortium will organise an Open Competition to award 2 to 3 participatory platforms with necessary resources to trial the tools, processes and methodologies developed through the project research activities, among their own communities.

The competition will be launched around September 2014, so that the tests can occur from January to April 2015.

PARTNERS

The CATALYST project, coordinated by Sigma Orionis, brings together five community partners (Imagination for People, Purpose, Euclid Network, CSCP and Wikitalia) engaged daily in curating very large online communities on social innovation and citizen engagement platforms, with two leading academic partners (The Open University and Zurich University) with an extraordinary record of applied and innovative research in the field of Collective Intelligence.
