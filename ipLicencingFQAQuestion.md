preparing initial material for [knowledge-base section at diasporachangemakers.net](http://template.diasporachangemakers.net/knowledge-base/) led me to consider the idea of [weAreThePlayMakers](http://wearetheplaymakers.com/) supporting "free as in freedom" [a.k.a. GPL v3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html)

i started to read the licence and automatically started to pick up on all the words which i would have to check the definition of in the light of recent developments in ip legislations and case law etc etc
